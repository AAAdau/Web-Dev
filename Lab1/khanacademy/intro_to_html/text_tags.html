        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do <em>algebra</em>.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br><strong>Thankfully, we are born to learn</strong>.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <strong>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit <em>stronger</em></strong>.<br> <strong>Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going</strong>.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
       <strong> are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand</strong>.<br>
        <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are</em>.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            You only have to know one thing:<br>
            <strong>You can learn anything</strong>.
